# Birding website — backend — v1

Backend operations that provide dynamic content to my personal Birding website.

This project uses Python as its primary programming language and is powered by Google Cloud Platform features such as:
data storage, easy deployment (CI/CD), autoscaling, and almost no-cost hosting.
